<h1>Learning</h1>
Hi, my name is Preston.<br>
    There's a cool picture <p id="pic">below...</p>
I'm a coding student.<br>
<p>I've taken an HTML course at a previous university. While interesting it didn't lead to a love of the subject material and I moved on and towards my studies of French and Art History. I have always thought I should return to the subject and am now forcing myself to do so. Plus, with the job market for coding in full swing it seems lucrative to learn and even down the road, knowing some coding will be useful in every position.</p><br>
    Below is my current favorite monster in D&D (Pathfinder, but I've adapted it for D&D). To see my sketch of it, check out my Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spikedonwhite/">spikedonwhite</a><br>
